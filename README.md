# Jukebox

This is a thingy to play music videos in the common room

### Ruby version
3.2.0

### System dependencies
These need to be in `$PATH`:
- [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
- [`mpv`](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv)

### Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)
Yup

### Deployment instructions
Hosting this on the internet would be verifiably stupid.
